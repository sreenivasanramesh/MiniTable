The files here are the ones used to create the javadoc
and src for the btree assignment.  The code is definitely
NOT usable due to all the manipulation for preparing
the documentation.

Note that the exceptions thrown in IndexFile and IndexFileScan
are deleted to give students the freedom to throw their own
exceptions when implementing BTIndexPage and BTLeafPage.

Only the *.class files and IndexFile.java IndexFileScan.java
are given out, acompanied with the javadoc documentation.
